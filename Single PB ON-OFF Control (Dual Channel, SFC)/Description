A single Push Button is used to turn ON or OFF a lamp.
Dual channel of such system has been created here.
A short press (less than 2s) will turn the lamp ON, and a long press (more than 2s) will turn the lamp OFF when the lamp is already ON.
When the lamp is OFF, a long press will turn the lamp ON for 1s and then turn it OFF.
